# Advanced Lane Finding
In this project, the goal is to build an advanced lane-finding algorithm to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. 
The steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("bird's-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Camera matrix and distortion coefficients

I start preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image. Then I compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients. Here is an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Distortion correction 

As a first step I apply the distortion correction while using the calculated camera matrix and distortion coefficients from above. The following figure shows an distortion corrected image in which we can see a difference of the hood of the car at the bottom of the image.

#### 2. Perspective transformation

As Next, I apply perspective transform which maps the points in a given image to different, desired, image points with a new perspective. In our case we are interested to get a birdâ€™s-eye view that let us view a lane from above. For that, I hardcode the source and destination points as following:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 595, 450      | 300, 0        | 
| 190, 720      | 300, 720      |
| 1130, 720     | 980, 720      |
| 690, 450      | 980, 0        |

Here's an example of my output for this step.

#### 3. Color thresholds 

I used color thresholds on different color spaces to generate a binary image. The color mask is splitted in a yellow and a white mask. I've converted the image to RGB and HLS space. The thresholds are chosen on emperical results. For the yellow mask I used the thresholds below:

|  Color Space  | Lower thres.  | Upper thres.  |  
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| RGB           | (225,180,0)   | (255,255,170) | 
| HLS           | (20,120,80)   | (45,200,255)  |

For the white mask the follwing thresholds are applied:

|  Color Space  | Lower thres.  | Upper thres.  |  
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| RGB           | (100,100,200) | (255,255,255) | 

Both are applied to the warped image. So the resulting binary image looks like this:

#### 4. Finding lane lines

I first calculate a histogram along all the columns in the lower half of the image. Further, I determine the position of two peaks of the histogram.

Then I use a sliding window algorithm as mentioned in the lessons and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

#### 5. Curvature and Vehicle's Offset

To determine the curvature I've followed the steps described in the lessons. With the polynomial fit for the left and right lane lines, I calculated the radius of curvature for each line according to formulas as mentioned in the lessons and this [tutorial](http://www.intmath.com/applications-differentiation/8-radius-curvature.php). For the final radius of curvature I took the average of both in meters, assuming 30 meters per 720 pixels in the vertical direction, and 3.7 meters per 700 pixels in the horizontal direction.

To determine the car's position I assume the camera is mounted at the center of the car, such that the lane center is the midpoint at the bottom of the image between the two detected lines. So the resulting vehicle's offset of the lane center from the center of the image (converted from pixels to meters) is the distance from the center of the lane.

Finally, the radius of curvature and vehicle's offset from center are displayed in the top left of each frame.

#### 6. Draw Detected Lane Boundaries

Finally, I warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image with displayed information about the radius of curvature and vehicle's offset from the lane center. Here is an example of my result:

### Pipeline (video)

#### Test on project video

The pipeline was applied on the provided project video and the final video result was quite well without any catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road.

Here's a [link to my video result](../advanced_lane_lines_output.mp4)

### Discussion

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and what possible improvements could be. 
This algorithm worked well on the provided project video because it is based on a simple color thresholding technique which means that the thresholds were adjusted to fit these conditions. Further, the algorithm has problems identifying lane lines in the challenge videos, because of the patched roads, different brightness and contrast conditions and the fact that the lanes are not clearly visible. More potential shortcomings could be crossing vehicles and different weather and light conditions. 

On the other hand possible improvements could be:

- Filter techniques for better estimation and stabilization,
- Tweak thresholds and use more color spaces for a robust detection under different conditions,
- Removing outliers with an region of interest (ROI),
- Sanity checks to verify that the detection makes sense.
